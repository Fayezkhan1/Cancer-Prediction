## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that assists in cancer detection based on patient data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a dataset of patients' features, medical history, and diagnostic outcomes, the project provides insights into the likelihood of cancer for a given patient, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about patients, including demographic features, medical history, and diagnostic results. The dataset is stored in a CSV file format.

## Evaluation

The project's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics assess the prediction model's accuracy and ability to detect cancer. 

## Contributing
